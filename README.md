# FillingStation

This is a fully fledged solution for managing any filling station. It has everything from managing and authorizing users to creating monthly sales reports.

I have removed the packages folder due to its large size.

Below is an image which shows all the packages for running this solution.

Before running, change the server and database information as you need.

Then run the entity framework migrations to create the database. Add a "Admin" user using management studio.

You are good to go.
